# How We Reading MMM Results

*Rethinking channel ROI, volume scale, and Trade-offs — for Budget Decisions.*

---

Once I worked on an MMM (Marketing Mix Modeling) project, and one of the key parts of the final report looked like this:

It’s a combined chart that shows us all the information we got (Spend % and Contribution sales %, alongside ROI points).

Recently, this made me rethink: **What insights does this chart show us?**
It was designed to provide a fair comparison across channels. 

However, this side-by-side way often inadvertently leads decision-makers to view the metrics in isolation: they gravitate toward a one-dimensional ROI ranking alone and lose sight of the context of scale.

**But is this all we need for budget planning?**

Imagine we move budget from Channel A to Channel B simply because B has a higher ROI. 

However, Channel A contributes 60% sales volume (of total marketing contribution), while Channel B contributes only 10% and is also more expensive.

The missing piece here is the relationship between efficiency and scale. 

If we blindly reallocate, we might find that Channel B quickly hits its ceiling, while the massive sales volume driven by Channel A begins to erode.

ROI feels like a "normalized" number allows for an easy (but often dangerous) leaderboard. It’s easier to say "5 is bigger than 2" than it is to say "A 2.0 ROI on $1M is actually more important to our growth than a 5.0 ROI on $10k."

In this case, focusing on ROI alone feels narrow. 

MMM should provide more than just a single efficiency metric. 
So maybe we should rephrase the question: 

## Are there better ways to visualize MMM outputs?

*A Scatter Chart: Contributed Sales Volume vs. ROI.*

The scatter plot of Contributed Sales Volume vs. ROI can help distinguish between major sales drivers and highly efficient players. We can categorize channels by four quadrants:

* High Volume / High ROI: **Growth engines**, rare top-tier performers. (Top-Right)
* High Volume / Low ROI: **Core foundations** that may need efficiency tuning. (Bottom-Right)
* Low Volume / High ROI: **Efficient niches** with potential for scaling. (Top-Left)
* Low Volume / Low ROI: **"Underperformer", or Ecosystem supporters** like upper-funnel or brand-building channels. (Bottom-Left)

We can also add bubble size to represent Media Spend, bringing cost into the same view:

Furthermore, this holistic view should be combined with marginal ROI curve analysis by each channel, to identify where we are hitting diminishing returns and how to precisely reallocate the budget.

## How We Reading MMM Results

Bar charts focus on channel efficiency, scatter plots highlight scale versus efficiency, and bubble charts bring budget risk into the picture.
Depending on the decision stage, one view may be more helpful than others.

Essentially, I realize that the real value of MMM is not about ranking channels from best to worst.
It’s about revealing the structural trade-offs behind the numbers.
