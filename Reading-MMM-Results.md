# How we Reading MMM Results

*Rethinking ROI, Contribution %, and Trade-offs — Without Oversimplifying Budget Decisions.*

---

Once I worked on an MMM (Marketing Mix Modeling) project, and one of the key parts of the final report looked like this:

[Chart]

It’s a combined chart that shows us all the information we got (Spend % and Contribution sales % alongside ROI points).

Recently, this made me rethink: What insights does this chart show us?

It was designed to provide a fair comparison across channels. 
However, this side-by-side way often inadvertently leads decision-makers to view the metrics in isolation: they gravitate toward a one-dimensional ROI ranking alone and lose sight of the context of scale.

**But is this all we need for budget planning?**

Imagine we move budget from Channel A to Channel B simply because B has a higher ROI. However, Channel A contributes 60% sales volume (of total marketing contribution), while Channel B contributes only 10% and is also more expensive.

The reason for this is  ROI feels like a "normalized" number allows for an easy (but often dangerous) leaderboard. It’s easier to say "5 is bigger than 2" than it is to say "A 2.0 ROI on $1M is actually more important to our growth than a 5.0 ROI on $10k."

The missing piece here is the relationship between efficiency and scale. If we blindly reallocate, we might find that Channel B quickly hits its ceiling, while the massive sales volume driven by Channel A begins to erode.

In this case, focusing on ROI alone feels narrow. MMM should provide more than just a single efficiency metric. 

So maybe we should rephrase the question: 

## Are there better ways to visualize MMM outputs?

A Contributed Sales Volume vs. ROI Scatter Chart.

The scatter plot of Contributed Sales Volume vs. ROI can help distinguish between major sales drivers and highly efficient players. By four quadrants we can categorize channels based on their portfolio:

We can also add bubble size to represent Media Spend, bringing cost into the same view:
