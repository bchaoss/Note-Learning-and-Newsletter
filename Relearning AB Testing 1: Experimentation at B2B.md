0. Experimentation in B2B is valuable and important 

1. Organizational-level randomization

   Smaller sample sizes

   Group matching

   right-skewed metrics

   sparse and lagging metrics

2. Remember the Fundamentals

   Good metrics —— Using lead metrics instead of ARR

   Don’t forget Power analysis

   Hypothesis

4. Advanced techniques

   Values of CUPED

   Stratified sampling

   PSM

   Heterogeneous reporting
